Utility Modules
===============

Helper utilities and tools used across PoliSim.

.. note::
   Utility modules are typically internal implementation details.
   Most users should use the high-level APIs in the core modules.

Currently, PoliSim does not expose a separate utils package. Utility functions
are integrated within the core modules as needed.
