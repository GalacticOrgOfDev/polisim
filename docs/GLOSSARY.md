# PoliSim Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of terms used in fiscal policy analysis, economic modeling, and the PoliSim platform.

---

## Economic Terms

### GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
Total value of all goods and services produced in a country in one year. Measured in current dollars (nominal) or inflation-adjusted dollars (real). PoliSim baseline: 2.2% annual real GDP growth.

### GDP Growth
Percentage increase in real GDP year-over-year. Typical range: 1-4% in developed economies. Higher growth → more tax revenue, lower deficit.

### Deficit
Annual shortfall when federal spending exceeds revenue. A negative deficit is a surplus. Formula: `Deficit = Total Spending - Total Revenue`

### Surplus
Annual excess when federal revenue exceeds spending. Opposite of deficit. The U.S. last ran a surplus in 2001.

### Debt (National Debt)
Cumulative federal borrowing over time. Formula: `Debt(year) = Debt(year-1) + Deficit(year)`. Current U.S. debt: ~$28 trillion.

### Debt-to-GDP Ratio
National debt as a percentage of GDP. Measures debt sustainability. Formula: `(Debt / GDP) × 100`. Current U.S. ratio: ~100%.

### Interest Rate
Cost of borrowing money, expressed as annual percentage. PoliSim baseline: 4.5%. Higher rates → higher debt service costs.

### Inflation
Rate at which prices increase over time. Measured by CPI (Consumer Price Index). PoliSim baseline: 2.5% annual. Higher inflation → higher nominal GDP but erodes purchasing power.

### Recession
Period of economic decline, typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Impacts revenue (lower tax receipts) and spending (higher safety net costs).

### Interest Payments (Debt Service)
Annual cost of servicing the national debt. Formula: `Interest = Debt × Interest Rate`. Projected to exceed defense spending by 2030.

### Nominal vs. Real
**Nominal:** In current dollars (not adjusted for inflation). **Real:** Adjusted for inflation to reflect true purchasing power.

## Tax Terms

### Tax Revenue
Total taxes collected by the federal government. Major sources: individual income tax (50%), payroll tax (36%), corporate tax (7%), other (7%).

### Individual Income Tax (IIT)
Tax on wages, salaries, investment income, and other personal income. Largest federal revenue source (~50% of total). Progressive tax structure (higher earners pay higher rates).

### Payroll Tax
Tax on wages to fund Social Security (12.4%) and Medicare (2.9%). Split between employer and employee. Subject to annual cap ($168,600 in 2024 for Social Security).

### Corporate Tax
Tax on business profits. Federal rate: 21% (flat rate since 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Contributes ~7% of federal revenue.

### Capital Gains Tax
Tax on investment profits (stocks, real estate, etc.). Long-term (>1 year): 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income. Short-term (<1 year): ordinary income rates.

### Marginal Tax Rate
Tax rate applied to the last dollar earned. In a progressive system, rates increase with income. Example: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, 37%.

### Effective Tax Rate
Average tax rate across all income. Formula: `(Total Tax / Total Income) × 100`. Always lower than marginal rate due to progressive brackets.

### Tax Elasticity
How much economic behavior changes in response to tax rate changes. Example: Wage elasticity of 0.2 means a 1% tax increase causes 0.2% reduction in hours worked.

### Behavioral Response
Changes in taxpayer behavior due to tax policy (e.g., working less, shifting income timing, tax avoidance). Critical for accurate revenue projections.

### Tax Expenditure
Revenue lost due to deductions, credits, and exemptions. Examples: mortgage interest deduction, charitable contributions, 401(k) contributions. Total ~$1.5 trillion annually.

### Carbon Tax
Tax on carbon emissions (e.g., $/ton of CO2). Proposed rates: $50-$100/ton. Estimated revenue: $50-$100B annually. Reduces emissions via price signal.

## Healthcare Terms

### Healthcare Spending
Total expenditures on medical care: hospitals, physicians, prescription drugs, insurance. U.S. current: 18% of GDP ($5.2 trillion).

### Coverage Rate
Percentage of population with health insurance. Current U.S.: ~93%. PoliSim target: 95-99%.

### Uninsured Rate
Percentage of population without health insurance. Current U.S.: ~7% (~23 million people).

### Administrative Overhead
Costs for insurance processing, billing, marketing, and profit. U.S. current: ~15-16%. Medicare: ~2%. PoliSim target: 3-5%.

### Single-Payer System
Government-run healthcare where one entity (the government) pays all medical bills. Examples: Medicare for All proposals. Eliminates private insurance.

### Public Option
Government-run insurance plan that competes with private insurers. Individuals can choose public or private coverage.

### Medicare
Federal health insurance for seniors (65+) and some disabled individuals. Enrollment: ~65 million. Spending: ~$900B annually.

### Medicaid
Federal-state health insurance for low-income individuals. Enrollment: ~85 million. Spending: ~$700B annually (combined federal and state).

### Medicare for All
Proposed single-payer system extending Medicare to all Americans. Eliminates private insurance. Estimated cost: $2-3 trillion annually (replaces existing spending).

### Healthcare Cost Elasticity
How much healthcare spending changes with price changes. Typical range: -0.2 to -0.5 (inelastic—people need healthcare regardless of price).

### Innovation Fund
Dedicated funding for medical research and development. Proposed: $50-100B annually. Goals: Cure diseases, reduce long-term costs, improve outcomes.

### Per-Capita Healthcare Cost
Average healthcare spending per person. U.S. current: ~$13,000. Other developed countries: $5,000-$7,000.

## Social Security Terms

### Social Security
Federal retirement, disability, and survivors insurance program. Funded by 12.4% payroll tax (split employer/employee).

### OASI (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance)
Social Security retirement benefits. Trust fund projected to deplete by 2033.

### DI (Disability Insurance)
Social Security disability benefits for workers unable to work. Funded separately from OASI.

### Trust Fund
Accumulated surplus from payroll taxes. OASI trust fund: ~$2.8 trillion (declining). When depleted, benefits paid from incoming taxes only (~75% of promised benefits).

### Trust Fund Depletion
Year when trust fund balance reaches zero. OASI: 2033. Combined OASDI: 2034. After depletion, incoming revenue covers only 75-80% of scheduled benefits.

### Payroll Tax Cap
Maximum wages subject to Social Security tax. 2024: $168,600. Wages above cap are not taxed. Controversial—removing cap would extend solvency.

### COLA (Cost-of-Living Adjustment)
Annual benefit increase to match inflation. Based on CPI-W (Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners). Recent: 2-3% annually. High inflation → higher COLA → faster trust fund depletion.

### Retirement Age (Full Retirement Age)
Age at which workers receive 100% of scheduled benefits. Current: 67 for those born 1960+. Can claim early (62) with reduced benefits or delay (70) for increased benefits.

### Benefit Formula
Calculation determining monthly benefit amount. Based on highest 35 years of earnings, adjusted for wage growth. Progressive: replaces higher % of income for lower earners.

## Spending Terms

### Federal Spending
Total government outlays. FY 2024: ~$6.8 trillion. Categories: mandatory (65%), discretionary (30%), interest (5%).

### Mandatory Spending
Spending required by existing law (not subject to annual appropriations). Examples: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. FY 2024: ~$4.3 trillion (65% of budget).

### Discretionary Spending
Spending set by annual appropriations (Congress decides each year). Examples: Defense, education, infrastructure. FY 2024: ~$1.8 trillion (30% of budget).

### Entitlements
Mandatory spending programs where eligible individuals are "entitled" to benefits. Examples: Social Security, Medicare, food stamps (SNAP).

### Defense Spending
Military and national security spending. FY 2024: ~$850 billion (~12% of budget). Largest discretionary category.

### Non-Defense Discretionary
Everything except defense: education, infrastructure, science, environment, justice. FY 2024: ~$950 billion (~14% of budget).

### Baseline Spending
Projected spending assuming current policy continues with no changes. Used as comparison point for policy proposals.

## Statistical Terms

### Monte Carlo Simulation
Method of running simulations thousands of times with random variations to understand uncertainty. PoliSim runs 1,000-10,000 iterations per simulation.

### Iteration
One run of a simulation with specific parameter values. More iterations → more accurate probability distribution but longer runtime.

### Confidence Interval (CI)
Range where the true value likely falls. 90% CI means 90% probability the true value is within the range. Example: Deficit 2030 = $1,400B [90% CI: $1,200B - $1,600B].

### P5, P50, P95
Percentiles from Monte Carlo distribution. **P5:** 5th percentile (pessimistic). **P50:** 50th percentile (median). **P95:** 95th percentile (optimistic).

### Standard Deviation (SD)
Measure of variability/uncertainty. Higher SD = more uncertain. Example: Deficit = $1,400B ± $200B (1 SD).

### Mean vs. Median
**Mean:** Average of all values. **Median (P50):** Middle value (half above, half below). Median often more representative when distribution is skewed.

### Distribution
Probability distribution showing all possible outcomes and their likelihoods. Normal (bell curve), lognormal, or uniform.

### Sensitivity Analysis
Testing how results change when varying individual assumptions. Identifies which parameters have the largest impact on outcomes.

### Elasticity
Percentage change in one variable given 1% change in another. Example: Healthcare elasticity = -0.3 means 1% price increase → 0.3% quantity decrease.

## Policy Terms

### Policy Lever
Adjustable parameter representing a policy choice. Examples: tax rates, spending levels, benefit amounts. PoliSim provides 50+ levers.

### Scenario
Combination of policy levers representing a complete policy package. Examples: "Progressive Scenario," "Conservative Scenario," "Medicare for All."

### Baseline (Current Policy)
Projection assuming no policy changes. Used as comparison point. Based on CBO baseline projections.

### Policy Impact
Change in outcomes (deficit, coverage, GDP) caused by a policy relative to baseline. Calculated as: `Policy Value - Baseline Value`.

### Budget Window
Time period over which policy is evaluated. Standard: 10 years. PoliSim supports 1-30 years.

### Dynamic Scoring
Accounting for macroeconomic feedback effects (e.g., tax cuts → higher GDP → more revenue). Opposite: static scoring (assumes no feedback).

### Paygo (Pay-As-You-Go)
Budget rule requiring new spending or tax cuts to be offset by spending cuts or tax increases. Goal: deficit neutrality.

### Deficit Neutral
Policy that doesn't increase the deficit. Revenue increases = spending increases, or spending cuts = tax cuts.

---

## PoliSim-Specific Terms

## Mathematical Terms

### Compounding
Growth that builds on itself. Example: 2.2% GDP growth compounded over 10 years = 24.4% total growth (not 22%).

### Present Value
Current value of future money, discounted by interest rate. $100 in 10 years at 4% rate = $67.56 today.

### Discount Rate
Interest rate used to calculate present value. Higher rate = lower present value.

### Net Present Value (NPV)
Sum of present values of all future cash flows. Used to evaluate policy costs/benefits over time.

### Annualized Rate
Growth rate expressed as annual percentage. Useful for comparing different time periods.

---

## Advanced Economic Terms

### Deadweight Loss
Economic inefficiency caused by taxes or regulations. Occurs when optimal production/consumption is not achieved.

### Laffer Curve
Theoretical relationship between tax rates and revenue. Shows revenue initially increases with rates but eventually declines (at very high rates, people work less).

### Crowding Out
When government borrowing reduces private investment by increasing interest rates. Controversial concept.

### Phillips Curve
Inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. Low unemployment → high inflation (and vice versa).

### Potential GDP
Maximum sustainable output without accelerating inflation. Actual GDP fluctuates around potential.

### Output Gap
Difference between actual GDP and potential GDP. Negative gap = recession. Positive gap = overheating economy.
