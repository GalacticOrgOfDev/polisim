# Test Outputs Directory

This folder contains CSV files generated by test scripts and simulations.

## Files

### Simulation Results
- `usgha_simulation_22y.csv` - Output from `main.py` and `run_health_sim.py`
- Contains 22-year USGHA simulation data

### Context-Aware Test Outputs
- `builtin_current_us_context_aware.csv` - Current US system (context-aware extraction)
- `builtin_usgha_context_aware.csv` - USGHA system (context-aware extraction)
- `simulation_context_aware.csv` - Generic context-aware simulation results

Generated by: `tests/test_builtin_context_aware.py` and `tests/test_context_aware_simulation.py`

## Note

These files are **not tracked in git** (excluded by `.gitignore`).
They are regenerated each time tests or simulations run.

If you need fresh data, delete these files and re-run:
```bash
python main.py              # Generates usgha_simulation_22y.csv
python run_health_sim.py    # Generates simulation results
```
