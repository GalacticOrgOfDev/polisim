**Section 2. Findings and Purposes**
(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States spends 18.5 percent of gross domestic product on healthcare in 2025,
exceeding all peer nations while producing a life expectancy of 78.4 years (versus an average
of 82.5 among comparable countries) and an infant mortality rate of 5.6 per 1,000 live births
(more than three times rates in leading peers like Japan and Norway).
(2) Medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States.
(3) Administrative inefficiencies and fragmented financing systems increase costs and reduce
access, with administrative waste accounting for 25–30 percent of spending.
(4) Biomedical innovation is hindered by misaligned incentives and variable market pricing.
(5) Future multiplanetary settlement requires advances in human biology, including extended
healthy lifespan, radiation resilience, and long-duration mission viability.
(6) Interstellar-range missions require median population lifespans exceeding 120 years and
radiation countermeasures capable of mitigating exposures exceeding 1 Sievert.
(7) A unified national health system can reduce expenditures, eliminate medical bankruptcy,
expand access, and accelerate innovation.
(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this Act are to:
(1) Provide universal zero-out-of-pocket healthcare coverage for all qualified individuals.
(2) Permanently eliminate medical bankruptcy.
(3) Achieve verifiable average health spending below 7 percent of gross domestic product by
2045, confirmed annually by the Congressional Budget Office, with interim milestones of 10
percent by 2040.
(4) Accelerate the largest medical, longevity, and human-performance innovation boom in
history.
(5) Generate fiscal surpluses equivalent to 1–2 percent of gross domestic product annually by
2040 for debt reduction, infrastructure, education, scientific research, space exploration, and
direct taxpayer rebates, audited by the Government Accountability Office.

imposed under sections 3101 and 3111 (Social Security and Medicare) and all private health
insurance premiums for qualified individuals.
---
**TITLE II: ESTABLISHMENT AND COVERAGE**
**CHAPTER 1: GALACTIC DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH**
**Section 4. Establishment of the Galactic Department of Health**
(a) Establishment.—There is established the Galactic Department of Health (GDOH), an
independent agency operating as a single-payer system for qualified individuals. The GDOH
shall incorporate the entirety of the Department of Health and Human Services and any
subsequent programs, consolidating redundant administrations.
(b) Coverage.—Beginning January 1, 2027, the GDOH shall provide zero-out-of-pocket
coverage for all medically necessary services, including:
(1) Hospital inpatient and outpatient care.
(2) Physician and specialist services.
(3) Mental health and substance use disorder treatment.
(4) Dental, vision, and hearing services.
(5) Prescription drugs and biologics.
(6) Rehabilitative and habilitative services.
(7) Preventive and wellness services.
(8) Maternity, newborn, and fertility care.
(9) Long-term care and home health services.
(10) Emergency services, including for non-qualified individuals.
(11) Evidence-based social-determinants-of-health services, including nutrition assistance when
prescribed as part of a covered care plan.
(c) Phased Rollout with State Pilots.—Full national implementation shall commence on January
1, 2035. Pilot Selection.—States shall be selected by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services in consultation with the Comptroller General, ensuring that at least 50 percent of
selected pilots represent bipartisan balance (defined as one Democratic-leaning and one
Republican-leaning state per region, per the Cook Partisan Voting Index for the most recent
gubernatorial election). [Retain existing text on funding/anti-rationing.] If fewer than 80 percent
of metrics (enrollment ≥90 percent, denials <2 percent, spending <13 percent of gross domestic
product) are achieved across pilots in any fiscal year, as verified quarterly by the Congressional
Budget Office, the Galactic Department of Health shall provide a federal backstop funding
equivalent to 0.1 percent of the prior fiscal year’s federal health expenditures, drawn from the
transitional reinsurance pool under section 6(b)(4), to stabilize provider reimbursements without
increasing overall Trust Fund outflows. Data from pilots shall inform surpluses via the Policy
Simulator under section 20, addressing federal overreach concerns while preserving automatic
enrollment nationwide post-pilot. Full national implementation shall commence on January 1,
2035, provided that if at least 15 pilots achieve 95 percent of metrics by fiscal year 2032, as
certified by the Government Accountability Office, such date shall accelerate to January 1, 2033.
(d) Anti-Rationing Guarantee.—
(1) The GDOH may not deny or delay any medically necessary service to a qualified individual
under age 75 that credible peer-reviewed evidence shows has at least a 65 percent probability
of extending healthy lifespan by 5 or more years or restoring capacity for work or independent
living. Evidence shall mean randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses published in journals
indexed by PubMed with impact factor ≥10, as listed annually by NIH guidelines; disputes
resolved by binding arbitration under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
(2) All such services shall be funded through a dedicated High-Value Care Account that may not
exceed 5 percent of total annual GDOH expenditures in any fiscal year.
(3) If demand exceeds limit, prioritize by expected healthy years gained per $1,000 incremental
cost, using NIH-validated models; top 80% fully covered if pilots under Sec. 4(c) demonstrate
<5% denial rates.
(e) Enrollment.—Automatic enrollment for all qualified individuals, with opt-out options under
section 5.
(f) Integration of Social Security.—Existing Social Security accounts are grandfathered, with
benefits payable as under current law. New accounts may be created, but funding shall derive
from the National Health and Longevity Trust Fund, including payroll contributions and surplus
dividends allocated under this Act, with a fiscal bridge fund equivalent to 0.1 percent of the prior
fiscal year's federal health expenditures for the first five years to cover overlaps during payroll
shifts.
**CHAPTER 2: OPT-OUT PROVISIONS AND VOUCHER SYSTEM**
**Section 5. Opt-Out Provisions and Voucher System**
(a) Opt-Out Eligibility.—Qualified individuals may opt out of GDOH coverage annually, receiving
a risk-adjusted voucher equivalent to 100 percent of per-capita GDOH spending, scaled by
CMS risk-adjustment factors for high-risk/older individuals, with annual recoupment of unused
funds exceeding 10 percent.
(b) Voucher Use.—Vouchers may fund:
(1) Private health plans.
(2) Health savings accounts.
(3) Direct primary care arrangements.
(c) Private Plan Restrictions.—Private plans funded by vouchers are limited to 2 percent
administrative and 8 percent profit margins. Re-enrollment in GDOH is penalty-free. Opt-out
rates shall be tracked as a determinable outcome metric with a target below 10 percent.
(d) State Supplements.—States may offer additional benefits without federal preemption.
---
**TITLE III: FUNDING AND TRANSITION**
**CHAPTER 1: FUNDING MECHANISMS AND TRANSITION**
**Section 6. Funding Mechanisms and Transition**
(a) National Health and Longevity Trust Fund.—All revenues under this section shall be
deposited into a dedicated National Health and Longevity Trust Fund.
(b) Transition Phase (Fiscal Years 2027–2036).—Funding sourced from:
(1) Redirection of existing federal health expenditures (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VA, ACA,
Department of Health and Human Services programs).
(2) Employer and employee health premiums converted to payroll contributions.
(3) Revenue-neutral tax adjustments to reduce net taxpayer burden, including phase-in of the 1
percent financial transaction tax on trades exceeding $10 million via reconciliation.
(4) Temporary high-cost reinsurance pool for claims exceeding 0.05 percent of gross domestic
product per enrollee per year during the transition phase, funded exclusively by the National
Health and Longevity Trust Fund and modeled on the Affordable Care Act transitional
reinsurance program and state 1332 waiver reinsurance programs.
(5) Disproportionate share hospital and graduate medical education funds following patients to
ease provider transition.
(6) Consolidation of nutrition and social determinants programs.—Effective January 1, 2028, the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), school lunch and breakfast programs under the
Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, the Emergency Food Assistance Program, and
all discretionary and block-grant programs administered by the Department of Health and
Human Services (other than those already transferred under paragraphs (1)–(5)) shall be
transferred to and administered by the GDOH as part of the National Health and Longevity Trust
Fund. Such programs shall be reformed and integrated as evidence-based
social-determinants-of-health interventions, with eligibility automatically aligned to GDOH
enrollment and benefits expanded to include preventive nutrition and housing supports where
demonstrated to reduce total cost of care by at least 5 percent per enrollee cohort, as verified
annually by the Policy Simulator.
(c) Ongoing Funding (Phased to Fiscal Year 2047).—Sources include:
(1) Payroll taxes as specified in subsection (e).
(2) Federal health program budgets.
(3) Most-favored-nation-minus-20 percent pricing for pharmaceuticals through GDOH contracts.
(4) A 1 percent financial transaction tax reallocation on trades exceeding $10 million.
(5) Reallocated 1 percent of existing excise taxes on luxury goods and unhealthy products. All
non-payroll sources limited to 20% of Trust Fund inflows, sourced solely from verified
efficiencies under Sec. 13.
(6) 12 percent of import tariffs.
(d) Fiscal Circuit Breakers.—If expenditures exceed 13 percent of gross domestic product, tax
rates freeze until compliance. Surpluses trigger automatic tax reductions (e.g., 1 percentage
point cut to top marginal income tax rate per surplus equivalent to 0.6 percent of gross domestic
product). If surpluses exceed 0.2 percent of gross domestic product, up to 8 percent shall be
allocated to provider bonuses for improved outcomes.
(e) Payroll Tax Cap and Allocation.—The total combined payroll tax rate (including employer
and employee shares) shall be capped at 15 percent. Of this 15 percent, 45 percent shall be
dedicated to the National Health and Longevity Trust Fund for health, longevity, and integrated
Social Security purposes, with 27.5 percent allocated to previous federal tax allocations and
27.5 percent to previous state tax allocations, reduced by the actuarial value of
employer-sponsored health premiums paid in the prior taxable year. The combined payroll
contribution shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by existing sections 3101/3111 taxes and
prior-year employer premiums, with CBO pre-enactment certification required for neutrality in
95% of income quintiles; if shortfall >5%, automatic phase-in delay by 1 year. This cap and
allocation shall be phased in over seven years following the date of enactment, with exemptions
for income below 0.05 percent of gross domestic product per capita and 50 percent rebates to
low earners via Earned Income Tax Credit expansion. All sources under subsections (b) and (c)
shall be pre-scored by the Congressional Budget Office within 90 days of enactment, with
alternatives triggered if shortfalls exceed 10 percent of projections.
(f) Escalator and Delay Provisions.—
(1) Health Inflation Escalator.—If the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index
for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Medical
Care component, exceeds 3 percent in any fiscal year during the phase-in period under
subsection (e), the combined payroll contribution rate shall automatically increase by 1
percentage point for the following fiscal year, with such increase allocated proportionally to the
National Health and Longevity Trust Fund and offset by equivalent reductions in the
employer-sponsored health premium deductions under subsection (e), as certified neutral by the
Congressional Budget Office prior to implementation.
(2) Auto-Delay Mechanism.—Any phase-in delay under subsection (e) due to shortfalls greater
than 5 percent shall apply exclusively to individuals in the top 20 percent income quintile, as
determined by Internal Revenue Service adjusted gross income thresholds for the prior taxable
year, with full implementation maintained for all other quintiles.
(3) IRS Pre-Audit Requirement.—Prior to the phase-in of any payroll contribution adjustments
under this section, the Internal Revenue Service, in consultation with the Congressional Budget
Office, shall conduct and publish a pre-audit of all offsets against sections 3101 and 3111 taxes
and prior-year employer premiums, ensuring dollar-for-dollar neutrality in at least 95 percent of
income quintiles. If the audit identifies discrepancies exceeding 2 percent, implementation shall
be delayed by 6 months, with quarterly updates tracked via the Policy Simulator under section
20
**CHAPTER 2: PRIVATE INSURANCE TRANSITION AND SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS**
**Section 7. Private Insurance Transition and Supplemental Options**
(a) Transition.—No new duplicative private policies may be issued after 540 days
post-enactment. Existing policies are grandfathered for up to 7 years in cohorts with satisfaction
rates exceeding 80 percent per Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems
surveys, with up to 0.2 percent of the prior fiscal year's federal health expenditures allocated as
a retraining fund for displaced workers.
(b) Supplemental Insurance.—Unrestricted for non-duplicative benefits. Private carriers may
contract with GDOH at fees not exceeding 5 percent.
(c) Employer Plans.—Employers may offer supplemental insurance or contribute to vouchers.

**TITLE IV: PRICING AND INNOVATION REFORMS**
**CHAPTER 1: PRICING REFORMS FOR PHARMACEUTICALS AND MEDICAL DEVICES**
**Section 8. Pricing Reforms for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices**
(a) Galactic Golden Ticket System.—Tiered pricing:
(1) Tier 1: Most-favored-nation.
(2) Tier 2: Most-favored-nation-minus-10 percent for high-value innovations.
(3) Tier 3: For longevity priorities (e.g., Alzheimer’s cures, radiation hardening), 5-year price
freedom, 100 percent research and development prizes, and government equity options
(capped at 5 percent per entity). Equity stakes shall be non-voting and automatically distributed
pro-rata to all American citizens via a sovereign wealth account upon liquidity event, with
validation required from the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration
for at least 10 percent lifespan extension in Phase III trials.
(4) Data-Sharing and Clawback Provisions.—Entities receiving Tier 3 benefits shall mandatorily
share all Phase IV post-market surveillance data, including real-world evidence on efficacy, with
the Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health via a public API accessible
through the Policy Simulator under section 20. If such data demonstrates less than a 5 percent
extension in healthspan or equivalent longevity metric, as verified by NIH epigenetic clock
models within 24 months of market entry, the Secretary shall impose clawbacks equivalent to
150 percent of excess revenues above most-favored-nation-minus-20 percent pricing, deposited
into the Galactic Health Innovation Fund, with disputes resolved by binding arbitration under
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
(b) Non-Compliance.—Leads to compulsory licensing at generic rates.
(c) Competition and Transparency Boosts.—All providers and facilities shall mandate
machine-readable, API-accessible pricing for all Current Procedural Terminology,
Diagnosis-Related Group, and National Drug Code identifiers, enforced via penalties equivalent
to 0.5 percent of annual revenue per violation, consistent with Medicare eligibility withholdings
and 2025 transparency rules. In state pilots under section 4(c), repeal barriers including
Certificate of Need laws and physician-owned hospital bans to enable direct primary care and
voucher competition, incorporating site-neutral payments for market efficiencies without eroding
universal coverage.

percent of the prior fiscal year’s nominal gross domestic product, drawn exclusively from
unobligated carryover balances in the Galactic Health Innovation Fund under section 9(a)(4), if
and only if the Longevity Moonshot Fund achieves at least one milestone under section 9(b) in
the prior two fiscal years; such base allocation shall escalate by 0.05 percentage points upon
verification of any additional milestone via the Policy Simulator under section 20, up to the
permanent floor of 0.75 percent.
(A) Extension of maximum healthy human lifespan and healthspan.
(B) Comprehensive genetic and pharmacological radiation countermeasures capable of
mitigating cumulative exposures exceeding 1 Sievert without significant loss of function.
(C) Bone, muscle, cardiovascular, and neurovestibular preservation in reduced-gravity and
high-radiation environments.
(D) Closed-loop life-support-compatible immunology and microbiome optimization.
(E) Reproductive biology and developmental resilience in partial-gravity and elevated-radiation
conditions.

0.05 percentage points each fiscal year beginning in 2035 until reaching a permanent floor of
0.75 percent of the prior fiscal year’s nominal gross domestic product, unless modified by a
subsequent Act of Congress (domains as specified in subparagraphs (1)(A)-(G)).
(3) Allocation requirements.—Of the amounts allocated under this subsection:
(A) Not less than 40 percent shall be awarded through milestone-based prizes and advance

authorized.
(4) Decoupling from Annual Count.—For purposes of the allocation under paragraph (1),
milestones shall be assessed on a biennial basis (e.g., fiscal years 2028–2029 as one period),
with carryover of unmet milestones to the subsequent period if verified within 12 months. No
allocation shall occur in a biennial period with zero verified milestones, but the base 0.1 percent
shall remain available as a contingency draw from the National Health and Longevity Trust Fund
if health expenditures fall below 10 percent of gross domestic product, as certified by the
Congressional Budget Office.
