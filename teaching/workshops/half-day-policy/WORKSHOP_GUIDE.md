2. Deficit Reduction (+$500B revenue, -$200B spending)

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the 30-year debt difference?
- What's the uncertainty range?
- Who benefits/loses?

---

### Card B: Progressive vs. Conservative

**Your Task:**
Compare progressive investment approach against fiscal conservative approach.

**Policies to Model:**
1. Progressive: Higher taxes, expanded programs
2. Conservative: Spending cuts, limited new revenue

**Questions to Answer:**
- Which reduces debt more?
- What are the trade-offs?
- Which is more politically feasible?

---

### Card C: Healthcare Focus

**Your Task:**
Compare healthcare reform options.

**Policies to Model:**

2. Medicare for All (simplified)

**Questions to Answer:**
- What are the 30-year cost differences?
- Coverage implications?
- Transition challenges?

---

### Card D: Tax Reform Focus

**Your Task:**
Compare tax reform approaches.

**Policies to Model:**

**Questions to Answer:**
- Revenue impact difference?
- Economic growth effects (assumed)?
- Distributional consequences?
