documentation:
when creating documentation, first check for pre-existing documentation that could be relevant.
if relevant documentation is found, update it with new information rather than creating a new document.
if pre-existing documentation is not found, create a new document in the `docs` directory.
if documentation is created, add a reference to it in the `README.md` file.
if documentation is found outside of the `docs` directory, move it to the `docs` directory and update any references to it.
if redundant documentation is found, consolidate it into a single document.

scripting:
when creating scripts, first check for pre-existing scripts that could be relevant.
if relevant scripts are found, update them with new information rather than creating a new script.
if pre-existing scripts are not found, create a new script.
if a script is created, add a reference to it in the `README.md` file.
if a script file has no documentation, refer to documentation instructions and create a documentation file in the `docs` directory.
when creating test scripts, name them `test_*.py` and place them in the `tests` directory.
if test scripts are found outside of the `tests` directory, move them to the `tests` directory.

api:
when creating api endpoints, first check for pre-existing endpoints that could be relevant.
if relevant endpoints are found, update them with new information rather than creating a new endpoint.
if pre-existing endpoints are not found, create a new endpoint.
if an endpoint is created, add a reference to it in the `README.md` file.
if an endpoint is created, create a documentation file for it in the `docs` directory.

mcp:
when creating mcp tools, first check for pre-existing tools that could be relevant.
if relevant tools are found, update them with new information rather than creating a new tool.
if pre-existing tools are not found, create a new tool.
if a tool is created, add a reference to it in the `README.md` file.
if a tool is created, create a documentation file for it in the `docs` directory.

friendly startup check:
when developing in our project, if a new dependency is added in a script, check if it is already installed before running the script.
if the dependency is not installed, add it to the `requirements.txt` file.
ensure that the projects friendly startup check is updated to reflect any new dependencies.

project structure:
when creating new files, ensure that they are placed in the appropriate directory.
if a new directory is needed, create it in the `src` directory.
ensure that all files have appropriate documentation and are referenced in the `README.md` file.

project specific instructions:
our project is known as polisim. when referring to it in documentation, use the name `polisim`.
our project requires context awareness for the majority of its functionality. this means if you can find 27 funding mechanisms in a policy, our extraction tool should also find 27 funding mechanisms. if you find a bill releives pressure on one system or another, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that creates a new system, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system works, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is funded, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is spent, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is allocated, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is taxed, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is regulated, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is administered, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is policed, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is enforced, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is monitored, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is evaluated, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is reported, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is audited, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is overseen, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is governed, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is managed, our tool should also find that. if you find a bill that changes the way a system is operated, our tool should also find that. context aware to us has emphasis on aware as in future development phases we will be integrating and building in AI systems to further improve the accuracy of the extraction tool.
this project is meant to be above and beyond government grade. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy analysis. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy simulation. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy comparison. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy visualization. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy communication. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy education. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy advocacy. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy research. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy development. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy implementation. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy evaluation. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy enforcement. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy monitoring. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy reporting. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy auditing. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy oversight. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy governance. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy management. it is meant to be the gold standard for policy operation. therefore the term fine tooth comb is appropriate to almost an atomic level of granularity.

Debug:
when debugging, use print statements to understand the flow of the program.
when debugging step through with a fine tooth comb, and document your findings in the debug.md in the `docs` directory.
after fine tooth comb stepping and documentation, follow debug.md to resolve the issues found.

github:
this instruction file should never be pushed to github. it is only for local use.
push to github only when you are explicitly told to do so.
