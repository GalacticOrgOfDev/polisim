# debug.md - Agent Workspace

**Purpose:** This is a working document for AI agents to document granular analysis findings during debugging sessions.

**How to use:**
1. Agent performs step-by-step code analysis, searching through each function in each file of the codebase with a fine toothed comb.
2. Agent logs findings, issues, and fixes here as they work.
3. This prevents losing track of progress during complex debugging sessions.
4. When complete, the user should walk through step by step with the agent completing tasks.
5. All findings and fixes are then moved to permanent documentation (VALIDATION_REPORT, CHANGELOG, etc.)
6. This file will then be emptied by the user for the next analysis session.

**Current Status:** Empty - Ready for next analysis
